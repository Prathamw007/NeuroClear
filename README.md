## ⚠️ Project Status & Scope
**Note:** This project serves as a technical exploration of **Agentic Workflows** using n8n and local inference integration.

* **Project Goal:** To successfully architect a parallel workflow where an LLM (Llama 3.2) manages user intent while a separate Python backend handles data processing.
* **Current Limitations:** The image restoration model is a lightweight **Proof of Concept (PoC)** trained for demonstration purposes. While it demonstrates the pipeline's functionality, the output images are not yet at a clinical diagnostic standard.
* **Key Learning:** The primary achievement is the successful orchestration of a full-stack local AI agent, completely decoupling the conversational interface from the compute-heavy backend.
